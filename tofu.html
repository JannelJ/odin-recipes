      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><p>Trim the root from the bok choy then thinly 
            slice widthways. Thinly slice the chestnut 
            mushrooms. Peel and grate the garlic.</p>

            <li><p>Drain the tofu and cut into 2cm cubes. Pop the cubes of 
                tofu into a large bowl and season with salt and pepper. 
                <br>Add the cornflour and shake the tofu in the bowl 
                to cover evenly.</p></li>
                <li>
                    <p>Pour the rice in a saucepan with a 1/4 tsp of 
                    salt. Cover with the lid and bring to boil.
                    Leave to cook for 10 mins.
                </li>

                <li><p>Heat a drizzle of oil in a pan and fry
                    the mushrooms until golden, 4-5 mins.
                    Stiry in the pak choi and allow to soften
                    slightly, 1-2mins. <br>Add the garlic, stir
                    together and cook for 1 min more. Transfer
                    the vegetables to a bowl and set aside.</p>
                </li>
                <li><p>Wipe out the pan and put back on high heat
                    with a drizzle of oil. When the oil is hot,
                    add the tofy and fry until golden, 3-4 mins.
                    <br>Meanwhile, mix the honey and miso together in
                    a small bowl.</li></p>
                </li>
                <li><p>Once the tofu is golden all over, allow the pan
                    to cool for a minute or so. Add the honey and 
                    miso mix into the pan. <br>As it begins to bubble,
                    stir the tofu in the miso to glaze all over, 1-2 mins.
                    Once the rice is cooked, fluff it up with a fork
                    <br>and stir through your mushroom and pak choi.
                    Pour in the soy sauce and mix evenly, 1-2 mins.</p>

                </li>
                <li><p>Divide the mushroom rice between your bowls and 
                    top woth crispy miso tofu. Enjoy!</p>
